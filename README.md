🚀 Job Role Recommendation Engine
📌 Overview
This project is a simple recommendation engine that suggests the most similar job roles based on shared required skills. It utilizes cosine similarity to measure the skill-based similarity between different job roles.

🎯 Features
✅ Accepts a job role as input and recommends the top N most similar roles
✅ Uses cosine similarity to compare roles based on shared skills
✅ Handles case-insensitive inputs and invalid role names gracefully
✅ Implements binary encoding for skill representation

🛠 Technologies Used
🐍 Python

📊 Pandas

📡 Scikit-learn

🔬 Methodology
1️⃣ Data Preparation
📌 A dataset of job roles and their required skills was created.
📌 Skills were converted into a binary matrix using MultiLabelBinarizer.

2️⃣ Similarity Calculation
📌 Cosine similarity was used to compare skill vectors.
📌 Similarity scores range from 0 to 1 (higher values indicate more similarity).

3️⃣ Recommendation Process
📌 The system identifies the top N roles with the highest similarity scores.
📌 Outputs a list of the most relevant roles.

🧠 Why Cosine Similarity?
✅ Works well with binary data (1 = skill present, 0 = skill absent)
✅ Focuses on skill overlap rather than the total number of skills
✅ Provides clear similarity scores for easy interpretation
